This spring, GitHub created a set of [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) to help individuals and Organizations better understand many of the nuances of Open Source. I've linked below to some of the guides that I think are helpful when Open Sourcing a new project.
- https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#launching-your-own-open-source-project
- https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#your-pre-launch-checklist

I also put some thoughts together on how you can decide which projects are worth open sourcing. You can see them here:
