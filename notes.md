GitHub for developers, why: https://medium.com/@sitapati/the-impact-github-is-having-on-your-software-career-right-now-6ce536ec0b50#.r6vxsmv78

GitHub [enables] a virtuous cycle for the rapid learning and improving of software programs that drives innovation faster and faster.”- Thomas Friedman

Being involved in open source brings trust/credibility to the company.

## Google and Open Source
Why/How Google decides what to Open Source: https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/28/google-publishes-its-documentation-for-open-sourcing-technology/

>  But generally speaking, Norris said, “our philosophy toward open source is we’re OK publishing something publicly unless there’s just a really good reason not to. Our default is, ‘Sure, why not?'”

> Often, an open source project emerges because a Googler or gaggle of Googlers enjoyed building something and wanted to share it, Norris said. There isn’t always a direct business reason, but that’s OK — it probably doesn’t hurt if Google technologies gain adoption outside Google’s doors, and seeing who works on the open source projects could help Google find the brightest talent to go after, too.

## What is Open Source Software

## Why Open Source for Corporations
- Open Source community
- Corporate Social Responsibility
- Increase the returns from your IT projects
- Public Relations
- As a great recruiting tool

### Details
- **Participate Open Source.** Being a member of the open source community signals to the market that the company is a modern technology company. As you can imagine, those that only support closed source software and don't participate in open source show a failure to keep up with the latest trends and technological improvements including Agile Development, DevOps principles and more.
- **A Desire to be a good corporate citizen in the open source community.** This is a company that respects a healthy give and take. We use a lot of open source, but we also want to give back in meaningful ways. This can be seen as corporate social responsibility, but for technology.
- **Improve technology and products by benefiting from open source solutions.** Corporations can benefit from the open source community finding bugs, adding new features, and generally providing ideas and suggestions to make the project better. In a world where there is downward pressure on budget and upward pressure on production, getting “free” work on projects is clearly a win.
- **Public Relations.** If a corporate open sourced project gains wide adoption, this can become great publicity. The company can claim related credit for the work of the community, and provides a way to show how the thought leadership they provide in their space. Examples include:
> “If Wells Fargo is doing this sort of great stuff with our open source block chain, imagine what  we’re doing with it!”

> “JPMC is happy that Wells Fargo is able to take the technology and products that we’ve developed and been able to show success in their own business.”  

Both of these statements relate JPMC to the success that Wells Fargo is having, and provide a position of community inclusion and superiority in the space.

- **As a great recruiting tool.** Not only does the top technical talent want to work with companies that are modern, and Open Source participation is one of the leading indicators of this, but it’s a great way for companies to gain insight into the pool of available talent. Similar to discussions around how Human Resources staff are expanding their research past the resume to developers GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, what better indicator of talent and skill than to have developers who are already contributing to your open source project and understanding your technology. It lets potential new employees signal their interest and skill at working on these projects while you can self select from a competitive talent pool, feeling confident in your investments.

An example is [Capital One] (https://developer.capitalone.com/blog-post/open-source-at-capital-one-on-floss-weekly-part-2-a-balanced-approach/) talking about their OSS recruitment.

Open Source lets you own the recruiting pipeline. Top tech companies build their own pipelines, and own the developers: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/id-pay-you-500000-year-cant-do-work-shelly-palmer

> A lot of developers are wanting to work in Open Source Software.
Jared Smith, Capital One

Some of the reasons why include:
Part of a team, exchange of ideas, working on highly functional and advanced capabilities. Increase their own skills, notoriety, and "brand." Be a part of something bigger than themselves.

-----

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Research into Corporate Inner Sourcing (the promotion of Open Source methodologies within a closed Corporation) by an Irish university shows that developers are 20% happier, stay at a company a year and half longer, and resulted in less churn.

This research was based on the study of software development in Europe, and presented at an Inner Source commons meeting in London, April 2016.

>       - Reducing technical debt

More from Jared:
- Open source and enterprise architect solving technical problems across different silos
- Join the dots between different efforts
- Biggest impetus:
    - Reduce duplication of effort
    - Example: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text searching system, needed by other groups
    - Caught early enough to collaborate on single solution
- But, usually find out too late
    - Problem becomes one of integration
    - Giving people an easy way to discover
    - Guidelines around when it's appropriate to use each one
    - When to start contributing
- Discoverability, making people feel like they can contribute
- Re-use, minimizing duplicated effort

Value of Open Source is realized in the rest of the business, not the OSS work itself.

## How to Open Source
### Culture
- build in time for inner source (time to close external Pull Requests)
- Takes extra up-front investment, but pays off in the long run
- code of conduct

> Let people follow their passion, developer mobility
Jared Smith, Capital One

### Governance
- Capital One has an open source office:
>  That’s what we do at the Open Source office here at Capital One. We make sure that we’re well-managed in the way we use open source and the way we contribute back to open source communities. We want to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn’t add risk for the company or risk our customers’ data. We look at various types of risk – legal risk, security risk, and reputational risk, and try to balance those with the advantages of using open source.

NGA, Google, Capital One have an open source office

### Implementation
- prescribe and document
- respect aysnc
- be a shepard of the community

> It also helps us from a recruiting standpoint. If we’re using a lot of open source, then we want to recruit people that have experience with open source software, especially with the tools and the libraries we’re using. Every opportunity that we have to find those people in the community who are looking for a job and want to work for us, that helps us to do our jobs better.



> There are advantages in the total cost of ownership of IT systems over the long run. Plus, it’s great being able to fix things yourself and not being tied to a specific vendor. Vendor lock-in is a huge deal in many technical organizations.
