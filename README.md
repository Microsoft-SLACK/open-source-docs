## Open Source Work

* Tools: Tools that make sense to use with open and inner source projects (GitHub in general)
* Notes: Preparing for my presentations


Organizations get out of Open Source what they put in. However, those benefits may not always be in software contributions, notoriety, or even activity.

Whether you are a modern software company like Netflix or Microsoft, a major bank like Capitol One , Goldman Sachs, or Societe Generale, or a media company like the BBC, open source is defining how modern companies operate.

## What do you mean by Open Source?
- Consuming best of breed, open source software, tools, and strategies internally
- Producing, sharing, and advocating for Open Source Software externally

OSS is a CxO concern just like an failing supply chain issue should be. That's one way to think of bullet 1 above, as a supply chain problem.

The [Open Source Fridays Business page](https://opensourcefriday.com/businesses) is a good discussion of benefits to the corporation (and how anyone can compete with the valley).
