## Open Source Consumption
Companies would like to control open source as it flows in to their business. products like Nexus from Sonatype address this at the binary level, but GitHub has the opportunity to address it at the source code level. This is necessary because we are the host of much of the world's open source code.

## License exposure
When open source is consumed and integrated into a larger commercial application behind the firewall, there is legal risk and exposure based on the license of the particular open-source project. Since GitHub hosts the original open source project being consumed, we should use our knowledge of its license information in a productive manner and surface that to the consumers of those projects.
