## Details
1. **The technology is the easiest part**
    - Tools are often a catalyst for change
    - With so much open and transparent actions,  technology facilitates this
    - Distrbuted and difused leadership means process is key. Technology can help to enforce this process
2. **Start small and go through the motions**
    - Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your Open Source Enterprise
    - Start with some small projects, but act like they are big. Build that muscle memory in lower-impact situations
3. **Minimize Information Imbalance**
    - Contributors are distributed throughout time and space, working as a team needs team-wide access to information
    - Wikis
    - Issues & Pull Requests
    - Software Documentation
    - GitHub Pages
4. **Embrace the constraints of Open Source**
    - Electronic : prefer systems that capture process automatically
    - Available: expose process and information via shared urls, not emails
    - Asynchronous: decisions made outside meetings, timezones
    - Informal: professional, but not formal
5. **Minimize Friction**
    - accelrate contributions
6. **Over-Communicate**
    - the people you are communicating to may not even be a part of your project yet. don't assume anything
