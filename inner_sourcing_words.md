## We'd like to learn more about Inner Source

 We're happy to hear that you're interested in learning more about Inner Source. With years of experience in the global open source community, GitHub provides the right tools to apply best practices to your collaborative in-house software development.

 Some of the most common practices we've seen among our customers:

 - Universal access to code and documentation, and allowing anyone to inspect and suggest contributions.
 - Peer review of contributions by others in the team or organization.
 - Informal communication channels, such as GitHub Issues and Pull Request, but also chat platforms such as [Slack](https://github.com/integrations/slack), [Hipchat](https://github.com/integrations/hipchat), or many other tools like these.
 - Liberty of choosing tasks, allowing developers to work on those work items they feel both confident and challenged by.

 There is also a lot of information available on the Internet on Inner Source:

 - GitHub's own [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/) contains a wealth of information on the best open source practices. Lots of these methods also apply to the realm of Inner Source. It goes without saying that [the Open Source Guide website is also open source](https://github.com/github/open-source-guide#open-source-guides), and invites anyone to contribute.
 - An introduction at [Inner Source Commons](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/) by PayPal, one of the largest promoters of Inner Source. You'll find an extensive list of articles on the subject on this site.
 - An interesting [blog post by Zalando](https://tech.zalando.com/blog/how-innersource-bolstered-integration-for-local-order-fulfillment/), on why they are adopting Inner Source and how it is helping their internal processes.

 *Optionally:*

 - GitHub frequently gives talks at conferences, tech events and meet-ups on open source, Inner Source, and our recommended best practices. _*Attached*_ you find a frequently used slide deck, in which we detail our view on software development.
