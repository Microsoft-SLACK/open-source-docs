## Open Source Organization Best Practices
Below is a checklist of sorts that you can use to set-up your GitHub Organization presence for SEB. These best practices will not only establish your GitHub presence as authoritative for SEB on GitHub.com, but also provide an easy way for your work to be discovered and the community to get involved.
- [ ] Org name that maps to your actual name (SEB?)
- [ ] Logo that maps to your corporate logo
- [ ] Description noting this is your Enterprise's Open Source Home
- [ ] Include website and email address, this helps to provide corporate authority
  - NOTE: I added internal feedback on your request to support a way to verify yourself as your org owner.
- [ ] Add welcome readme to serve as FAQ, contact info, and other basic rules of engagement for your account.
- [ ] Add website (can be hosted by GitHub Pages) to provide a non-GitHub presence for your Enterprise.
   -  Can mirror sites such as https://netflix.github.io/, https://developer.github.com, https://opensource.google.com/, or https://spotify.github.io/.
   - GitHub Pages lets you iterate through the repositories in your Organization to easily make a dynamic website for listing your GitHub Projects.
