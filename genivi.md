  There are a few key aspects of that I see continuously throughout my travels with many of GitHub's corporate open source customers:
  * Commitment to Open Source throughout the organization, from developers and technologists to management and CTOs. This will often include specific duties for a Vice President or CTO.
  * An office or team within the company empowered to set open source policy, smooth adoption within the organization, and handle coordinate necessary details including Public Relations, Legal, and Technical Tooling.
  * Willingness to engage the open source community with your projects, even if they help your competitors. A rising tide lifts all boats, and the benefits received from the open source leadership far outweighs the losses due to this limited competitive advantage.
  * Embrace an open source culture that encourages cross pollination of ideas and experimentation, not just strictly defined teams with limited focuses.
  * Be willing to measure the success of your open source efforts by the health of your engineering and software development, not purely dollar value or externally submitted patches.
  * Be willing to embrace technology and tooling (open source, off the shelf, and custom-built) to streamline, automate, and enhance the workflow and processes of your efforts.
  * Efforts to engage the community and meet them where they are. This means making projects more easily discoverable, accessible, and inviting.

  When we talk about software and tooling that is being used to empower corporate open source,
  * I think of the `OSSMetaData` file format that Netflix created to better keep track of their efforts internally.
  * I think of all the work Microsoft has put into ease of use and discovery of their projects, from their GitHub pages site (https://microsoft.github.io), to visual studio code and the GitHub integrations in the latest Visual Studios.
  * Using tools like [Truffle Hog](http://windowsitpro.com/security/truffle-hog-finds-security-keys-hidden-github-code
) and [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) to automate some aspects of security and code inspection.
  * Tools like [Git Magic](https://gitmagic.io/),  [Netflix's Hub Commander](https://github.com/Netflix/hubcommander), and [All Contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) to help manage, and build, a better community.
  * Tools like [OSS Tracker](https://github.com/Netflix/osstracker), [FOSS Heartbeat](https://github.com/sarahsharp/foss-heartbeat), and the [ReadMe algorithm](http://demos.algorithmia.com/github-readme-analyzer/) to help maintain better communities.

  Hopefully these are a start to your efforts on building out good communities, and I look forward to talking to you more about this soon.

  Thanks,
