gsa/18f: Open Source by default, only exceptions https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md#exceptions

## Questions to ask yourself re: what should you make your project available to the public as OSS:
-    Would you use this product yourself if someone else made it available as OpenSource?
-    Do I think other people would find this valuable?
-    How will you support it = provide maintenance (provide community support) Apache/Eclipse foundatioan, public domain
-    Answer questions, updates to latest ersion of Ruby/Java, address bug?
-    Legal issues needing to be resolved – trademarks, copyright
  - Is your OpenSource too tied to some internal proprietary thing that can't be released
    - eg, Released patent for `Spokes` – DGit infringing on Git name-mark
-    How you want to support outside contributors – should they sign Contributors License Agreement or DCO (Linux’s version)
-    How you manage roadmap going forward?
  - eg, What if contributors want to take project in a direction Visa may not want to go
-    Once you OpenSource something, does Visa want to commit to coding in open on project or continue to code internally and share with OSS.  Can share issues, PRs – reason why you wrote the code.  Flexbility to experiment internally without having to do in public, in open
